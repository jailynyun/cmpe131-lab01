Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate 
on a single project because it allows for each engineer to work on their own branch
and add their progress safely at the same time. It prevents the main branch from problems by 
keeping it clear and safe from errors that may appear on individual branches. You can
easily revert issues on individual branches, preventing reverting the main branch.
